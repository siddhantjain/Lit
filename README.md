Lost in Translation(Lit) is a compiler created as a part of the course on Programming Languages and Compiler Construction.

COMMAND LINE RUN STATEMENT: "python src/main.py examples/test2.txt error_lit.txt tokens_lit.txt"
GENERATED FILES:
1. parsetree.txt - list of grammar rules used in parsing.
2. parsetree2.txt - parse tree printed in more intuitive format
3. ASTfile.txt - Abstract Syntax Tree printed in intuitive format
4. codegen.txt - contains the assembly language code generated
5. error_lit.txt - Information about errors(If any) [Filename as per third command line argument]
6. tokens_lit.txt - Token Stream generated by lexer [Filename as per fourth command line argument]

## Language Specifications

The specifications for the language can be viewed in the file named Language Specifications.txt

## Lexer

    "src/lexicalanalyser.py"
*       The lexer has been hand-written in Python
*       The re module has been extensively used for pattern matching
*       Formed regexes are available in the file data.py
*       The lexical analyser has 0 look-aheads but principal of longest match is satisfied through the order in which the regexes are tested


## Grammar

* The grammar is LL(1) compliant and the rules have been written in the grammar.txt file. The corresponding parse table has been represented in the ParseTable.xslx file. 
    Note: The numbers in the parse table refer to the rule numbers as in the grammar.txt file.
